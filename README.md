# Neural Network Simulator

This repo contains an implementation of neural network using Python. We provide gradient descent (stochastic, batch, and mini-batch) and backpropagation to train the network, along with k-fold cross validation and a hyperparameter optimization method (grid search).

The simulator is applied to MONKâ€™s classification problem in `test_monk.py`.
